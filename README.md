# Eclipse Trace Compass

<img align="right" src="doc/images/tc-logo.png">

`Eclipse Trace Compass™` is an open source application to solve performance and
reliability issues by reading and analyzing logs or traces of a system. Its goal
is to provide views, graphs, metrics, and more to help extract useful
information from traces, in a way that is more user-friendly and informative
than huge text dumps.

`Eclipse Trace Compass` is also a framework to build such trace analysis and
visualization tools. It provides Eclipse extension points, declarative XML and
scripting capabilities to extend the core Trace Compass functionality for 
domain-specific trace formats and use cases.

For more information about the key features, see [Trace Compass website](https://eclipse.dev/tracecompass/).
