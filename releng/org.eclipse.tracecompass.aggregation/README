This project creates an maven repository with all dependencies needed for
Trace Compass CTF core and parser plug-in installed. The location of the
generated maven repository by default is 
releng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.aggregation/target/final. 

This can be changed in the tracecompass.aggr file.

Install Eclipse CBI aggregator, e.g. using update site (or later version):
http://download.eclipse.org/cbi/updates/aggregator/ide/4.13/

It can be separately built by the following commands:
cd releng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.aggregation
mvn clean install
