/**
 * Interface that hooks analysis modules to the rest of TMF. Analysis modules
 * are a set of operations to be run on a trace (or experiment). They will
 * typically either provide outputs to the end user, or feed other analysis.
 *
 * An analysis module must tell what trace type it applies to and if it can be
 * executed on a given trace of the right type.
 *
 * Implementations of this interface must define how an analysis will be
 * executed once scheduled and provide help texts to describe how to use the
 * analysis.
 *
 * Analysis can also take parameters, manually set, through default values or
 * using an {@link IAnalysisParameterProvider}. {@link IAnalysisOutput} can also
 * be registered to an analysis modules to display the results of the analysis.
 *
 * This interface just allows to hook the analysis to the TMF framework, but the
 * developer is free to implement the internals of its operations the way he
 * wishes.
